# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

one:
  title: MyString
  header: MyText

two:
  title: MyString
  header: MyText

##If you are working with associations, you can simply define a reference node between two different fixtures. Here's an example with a belongs_to/has_many association:

# In fixtures/categories.yml
#about:
#  name: About
# 
# In fixtures/articles.yml
#one:
#  title: Welcome to Rails!
#  body: Hello world!
#  category: about
